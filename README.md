About Auth
==========
This is a React Native application to practice authentication with Firebase. Users are able to log in and out of the application. 
An account is automatically created if the user tries to sign in with an email that doesn't exist in our database.
>
This is my second React Native application that I created by following along Stephen Grider's course on Udemy "**The Complete React Native and Redux Course**".
